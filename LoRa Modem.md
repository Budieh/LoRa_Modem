# LoRa Module

This project involves the development of a LoRa Modem using a Nucleo L476RG board and an SX1261 LoRa modem chip. The code and project details are thoroughly documented within the source code in the form of comments.

## Overview

- **Hardware Components**:
  - **Nucleo L476RG Board**: A development board based on the ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller.
  - **SX1261 LoRa Modem Chip**: A low-power, long-range transceiver for IoT applications.

- **Code Details**:
  The source code includes comprehensive comments that describe the functionality, setup, and implementation details for configuring and utilizing the LoRa modem.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup the Hardware**:
   - Connect the SX1261 LoRa modem board to the Nucleo L476RG board using the inner sockets compatible with the Arduino pins layout.

2. **Compile and Upload the Code**:
   - Use an appropriate IDE (e.g., STM32CubeIDE) to compile and upload the provided code to the Nucleo L476RG board.

3. **Run the Code**:
   - After uploading, run the code and follow the comments within the source code for further instructions and information.

## Further Information

- **Documentation**:
  - Detailed documentation can be found within the source code itself. Comments have been added to provide clarity and guidance.

Good luck with your LoRa Module project!
